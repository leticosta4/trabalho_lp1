# trabalho_lp1
#This is a simple bakery-system program, written in C language, using dinamic memory access, global variables and a struct data type .
#It provides 5 simple operations: include, consult, change, display and exclude items. At the end of it, a text file is generated, containing the data included since its first run.
#For modularization, the program contains 9 core functions, apart from the "main", of different types, such as "void", "int" and "char".
#(this code was developed during the 2nd semester of a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. Curricular component: programming language 1.)
